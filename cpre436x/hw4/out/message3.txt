Come in close.
Closer.
Because the more you think you see,
the easier it'll be to fool you.
Because what is seeing?
You're looking, but what you're really
doing is filtering, interpreting,
searching for meaning.
My job?
To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,
and use it against you.

Project1b Description: In this iteration of project 1, we added two system calls - nice and getpstat
	nice: This system call takes a single integer, and sets the current process's nice value to that parameter. 
			If the parameter is > 19 or < -20, the function returns 1 (error). If the call is successful, it returns
			0. To implement this, we added a field to the proc struct called "nicevalue" in "proc.h". The default nicevalue 
			is 10, and it is set while allocating the process.
			
	getpstat: This system call takes a pstat struct (defined in "kernel/pstat.h") as a parameter and sets that struct's fields
				to include information about every process that is not in the UNUSED state. Its fields are inuse[NPROC], pid[NPROC],
				and nice[PID]. This allows us a way to see the state, pid, and nice value of every single process in a single struct.
				
List of Files Added: "getpstat.c", "nice.c", "pstat.h"

List of Files Modified: Kernel - "syscall.h", "syscall.c", "sysproc.c", "proc.h", "proc.c"
						User - "usys.pl", "user.h"
						Makefile
						
Project1c Description: In this iteration of the project, we added two more schedulers: round robin and stride. Both of them use a queue
						pull the process that needs to be ran. Implementation was not exactly like the textbook provided in the specs,
						but was inspired by the concepts introduced.
List of Files Modified: Kernel - "defs.h", "main.c", "param.h", "proc.h", "proc.c"
